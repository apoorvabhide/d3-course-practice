    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        I am Apoorva, I'm from India. <br> 
        After studying Electronics & Instrumentation Engineering from BITS Pilani, I've been working as a Decision Scientist in Mu Sigma, a Data Analytics firm.

    <h2>Why Data Science?</h2>
    <p>
        The aspect of Data Science that has attracted me the most is the interdisciplinarity.<br>
        For example, we are currently a team of data analysts working across fields like Retail, Shopping Malls, and Cinemas.<br>
        Even in my own free time, I've completed projects on Customer sentiment, on Cricket, which is a sport I love <i>dearly</i>, as well as with forecasting energy consumption.<br>
        That's what I've loved about data science - it's a set of tools that can be customised to understand and help any domain.
